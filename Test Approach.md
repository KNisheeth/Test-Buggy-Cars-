A test approach is the test strategy implementation of a project (in this case a website i.e. https://buggy.justtestit.org/), defines how testing would be carried out. So when we are testing an already developed website its called a reactive approach. 
In this approach we will do some exploratory testing to identify the functionality of the application. Where we try to learn about the application, and design & execute the test plans accordingly. Hence, exection and evaluation are concurrent tasks.
